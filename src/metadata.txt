about=Easy and quick access to open geospatial data for Greece. Refer <a href="https://www.elymperis.com/greekdata-qgis">here</a> for more information. Originally developed for <a href="https://www.geomeletitiki.gr">Geomeletitiki Consulting Engineers</a> by <a href="https://gr.linkedin.com/in/efstathios-lymperis-975702188">Efstathios Lymperis</a>, Geoscientist & Geospatial Software Engineer.<br /> <br /> Version 2.0 is a complete re-write and features a new interface, along with some other features. You can read more <a href="https://www.elymperis.com/greekdata-qgis">here</a>. The main change, is that fetched layers are now cached in a local settings.json file, so that they can be searched through and accessed easily. They then get updated every 7 days. Since the change is quite significant, the version has been bumped to 2.0.0, and your feedback is more than welcome.
